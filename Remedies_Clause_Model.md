# Model Clause — Integrity Default & Structural Remedy

**Integrity Default.** Where a Required Certified Record is not published with a valid DOI and matching SHA‑256/AVE entry within [X] days of decision or issuance, a rebuttable presumption of procedural defect arises.

**Court-Ordered Relief.** On application, the court may order:
1) Publication and ledger registration within [Y] days;
2) Interim declaratory relief confirming the procedural duty;
3) Where prejudice is shown, a **structural interdict** with compliance reporting at intervals of [Z] days until substantial compliance.

**Burden & Evidence.** The respondent may rebut by producing a Certified Record with:
- DOI landing page, 
- SHA‑256 value matching the published artifact, and
- AVE ledger entry showing timestamp ≤ [X] days and chain-of-custody continuity.

**Notice.** Ledger registration constitutes constructive public notice of the record’s issuance and integrity as of the AVE timestamp.
